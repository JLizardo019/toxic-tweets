# Toxic Tweets
A data visualization project where you can search tweets with a keyword and analyze its toxicity. 

<strong>Note: This site is project is no longer functional due to Twitter's new API developer plans and limited access to read tweets.</strong>
Unfortunately, there is only a video from an initial iteration to showcase the animation. However, it does not do the latest animation justice. I will work on finding a work around for the future.

## Summary
This project uses the Twitter API to pull the 100 most recent tweets that contain word 1 and word 2, respectively. Each tweet is represented by a moving dot. The dot size represents how positive the tweet is: the larger the dot the more negative the tweet. Tweets that are characterized toxic by the TensorFlow model Toxicity are represented as a red dot. "Toxic" means containing hateful and derogatory language. Hover your mouse over the dots to align them from most negative to most positive and read the tweet.
